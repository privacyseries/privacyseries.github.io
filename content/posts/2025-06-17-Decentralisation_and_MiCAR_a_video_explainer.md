*The Monero Policy Working Group (MPWG) is a loose quorum of individuals attempting to engage in regulatory and policy conversations regarding cryptocurrency, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.*

## Introduction

Prevsiously, we [published](https://privacyseries.github.io/posts/2025-03-25-decentralisation_and_micar/) an article on the interrelation between MiCAR and the concept of decentralisation. That article outlined how MiCAR deals with the concept, and how it might impact various projects in the DLT ecosystem.  

## A video explainer

[Stack Wallet](https://stackwallet.com/) have since published the first video of a beautiful two-part series, that will outline the main points of that article. 

It can be found below...(enjoy)
